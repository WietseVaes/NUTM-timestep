    "for a small $t$ where $g(k)$ has poles only on the real line. To this end, we compute a different integral. For this purpose, put $x$ into polar form: $x=re^{iϕ}$. The integral we wish to compute is \n",

However, note that $t^{-1/n} → \\infty$ as $t → 0$, so we hope that $\\mathcal{R}e(izt^{-1/n}r) ≤ 0$. Since $t,r>0$, we hope that $\\mathcal{R}e(iz)≤0$ or $\\mathcal{I}m(z)≥0$. Therefore, we hope that $z$ is in the upper half plane (UHP).\n",
    "## The deformation\n",
    " Now, why am I talking about the complex plane all of a suddon? Deformations, of course! Because of these poles, we deform to $\\Gamma$. For this we need to suffice two conditions. First, $\\mathcal{I}m(z)≥0$ which is true if $z$ is real or when it is in the UHP, easy. The more difficult part is the need for $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)\\geq0$. This necesity prohibits the integral itself to not even exist, namely if  $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n})<0$ or $\\mathcal{R}e((-1)^nw_{n})<0$ we are, excuse my French, fucked. However, let's assume its integrable, then we want $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)\\geq0$ for $z$ in the UHP. Define $w_{n}=w_r+w_ii$ and $z_{n}=z_r+z_ii=re^{iθ}$, we then find where $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)=0$:\n",

    "Since we need $z$ to be in UHP, $θ_j \\in [0, π]$. \n",

    "For the deformation to happen, we aim to use Jordan's lemma. We make circle segments over that domain where $\\Omega_+=\\{z|\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)\\geq0\\}$. The integral over these will go to zero because of Jordan's lemma. Sadly, the UHP does not consist of only $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)\\geq0$. One could then deform to go back to zero, avoid $\\Omega_-=\\{z|\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)<0\\}$ and then go back to infinity in $\\Omega_+$. But the whole reason for deforming is so that we escape $z=0$. Therefore, we need to go through the $\\Omega_-$. For this we use steepest descent. Once we have this deformation path, we can use that $g$ and the exponential are analytic in the UHP so get the integral we hope to get, through decomposing the full path into that over the real line and $\\Gamma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we try to find the path through which we will go to and come back from infinity over the good regions $\\Omega_+$. The main idea is that we aim to maximize $\\mathcal{R}e(w_{n}z^n)$ in every region. This is easy to find:\n",

    "Over $\\Omega_-$, we will go through the critical points of $ikx-ω(kt^{-1/n})t$, which is easy to compute automaticaly though companion matrices. As for how we go through it, we take the shortest path through the critical point, which is perendicular to $r ↦ r\\exp((θ_j+θ_{j+1})/2)$, where $θ_j$ and $θ_{j+1}$ are boundaries of $Ω_-$."
